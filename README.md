## Introduction
Forggith Pharmaceuticals (Forggith) is a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing company based in Germany. As a Manufacturing company, they produce medical drugs which get to the consumers through their Distributors.

Forggith provided a template for their distributors to capture records of their sales which are then sent to Forggith on a monthly basis. This data is then used for reporting and analysis by Forggith to achieve their goals Sales and Marketing objectives through tracking and monitoring of KPIs.

In their efforts to maximise growth, Forggith works with a team of Sales and Marketing pros who ensure retailers are able to get their products through the distributors.
